                      The BBC has uncovered details of a secret deal that let
                      hundreds of IS fighters and their families escape from
                      Raqqa, under the gaze of the US and British-led coalition
                      and Kurdish-led forces who control the city.<br /><br />A
                      convoy included some of IS’s most notorious members and –
                      despite reassurances – dozens of foreign fighters. Some of
                      those have spread out across Syria, even making it as far as
                      Turkey.

                        Lorry driver Abu Fawzi thought it was going to be just
                        another job.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He drives an 18-wheeler across some of the most dangerous
                        territory in northern Syria. Bombed-out bridges, deep
                        desert sand, even government forces and so-called Islamic
                        State fighters don’t stand in the way of a delivery.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But this time, his load was to be human cargo. The Syrian
                        Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab
                        fighters opposed to IS, wanted him to lead a convoy that
                        would take hundreds of families displaced by fighting from
                        the town of Tabqa on the Euphrates river to a camp further
                        north.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The job would take six hours, maximum – or at least that's
                        what he was told.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But when he and his fellow drivers assembled their convoy
                        early on 12 October, they realised they had been lied to.
                      </p>
                     
                        
                      <p>
                        Instead, it would take three days of hard driving,
                        carrying a deadly cargo - hundreds of IS fighters, their
                        families and tonnes of weapons and ammunition.

                        Abu Fawzi and dozens of other drivers were promised
                        thousands of dollars for the task but it had to remain
                        secret.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The deal to let IS fighters escape from Raqqa – de facto
                        capital of their self-declared caliphate – had been
                        arranged by local officials. It came after four months of
                        fighting that left the city obliterated and almost devoid
                        of people. It would spare lives and bring fighting to an
                        end. The lives of the Arab, Kurdish and other fighters
                        opposing IS would be spared.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But it also enabled many hundreds of IS fighters to escape
                        from the city. At the time, neither the US and British-led
                        coalition, nor the SDF, which it backs, wanted to admit
                        their part.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Has the pact, which stood as Raqqa’s dirty secret,
                        unleashed a threat to the outside world - one that has
                        enabled militants to spread far and wide across Syria and
                        beyond?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Great pains were taken to hide it from the world. But the
                        BBC has spoken to dozens of people who were either on the
                        convoy, or observed it, and to the men who negotiated the
                        deal.

                          In a greasy yard in Tabqa, underneath a date palm, three
                          boys are busy at work rebuilding a lorry engine. They
                          are covered in motor oil. Their hair, black and oily,
                          stands on end.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Near them is a group of drivers. Abu Fawzi is at the
                          centre, conspicuous in his bright red jacket. It matches
                          the colour of his beloved 18-wheeler. He’s clearly the
                          leader, quick to offer tea and cigarettes. At first he
                          says he doesn’t want to speak but soon changes his mind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          He and the rest of the drivers are angry. It’s weeks
                          since they risked their lives for a journey that ruined
                          engines and broke axles but still they haven’t been
                          paid. It was a journey to hell and back, he says.

                          says. “We were supposed to go in with the SDF, but we
                          went alone. As soon as we entered, we saw IS fighters
                          with their weapons and suicide belts on. They
                          booby-trapped our trucks. If something were to go wrong
                          in the deal, they would bomb the entire convoy. Even
                          their children and women had suicide belts on.”

                          The Kurdish-led SDF cleared Raqqa of media. Islamic
                          State’s escape from its base would not be televised.

                          Publicly, the SDF said that only a few dozen fighters
                          had been able to leave, all of them locals.

                          Another driver says the convoy was six to seven
                          kilometres long. It included almost 50 trucks, 13 buses
                          and more than 100 of the Islamic State group’s own
                          vehicles. IS fighters, their faces covered, sat
                          defiantly on top of some of the vehicles.

                          agreement to take only personal weapons, IS fighters
                          took everything they could carry. Ten trucks were loaded
                          with weapons and ammunition.

                          This wasn’t so much an evacuation - it was the exodus of

                          The SDF didn’t want the retreat from Raqqa to look like
                          an escape to victory. No flags or banners would be
                          allowed to be flown from the convoy as it left the city,

                          It was also understood that no foreigners would be
                          allowed to leave Raqqa alive.

                          Back in May, US Defence Secretary James Mattis described
                          the fight against IS as a war of “annihilation”.“Our
                          intention is that the foreign fighters do not survive
                          the fight to return home to north Africa, to Europe, to
                          America, to Asia, to Africa. We are not going to allow
                          them to do so,” he said on US television.

                          But foreign fighters – those not from Syria and Iraq -
                          were also able to join the convoy, according to the
                          drivers. One explains:

                          In light of the BBC investigation, the coalition now
                          admits the part it played in the deal. Some 250 IS
                          fighters were allowed to leave Raqqa, with 3,500 of
                          their family members.

                          “We didn’t want anyone to leave,” says Col Ryan Dillon,
                          spokesman for Operation Inherent Resolve, the Western
                          coalition against IS.

                          “But this goes to the heart of our strategy, ‘by, with
                          and through’ local leaders on the ground. It comes down
                          to Syrians – they are the ones fighting and dying, they
                          get to make the decisions regarding operations,” he
                          says.

                          While a Western officer was present for the
                          negotiations, they didn’t take an “active part” in the
                          discussions. Col Dillon maintains, though, that only
                          four foreign fighters left and they are now in SDF
                          custody.

                          As it left the city, the convoy would pass through the
                          well-irrigated cotton and wheat fields north of Raqqa.
                          Small villages gave way to desert. The convoy left the
                          main road and took to tracks across the desert. The
                          trucks found it hard going, but it was much harder for
                          the men behind the wheel.

                      <p>Shopkeeper Mahmoud doesn’t get intimidated by much.</p>
                      <p>
                        It was about four in the afternoon when an SDF convoy
                        drove through his town, Shanine, and everyone was told to
                        go indoors.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “We were here and an SDF vehicle stopped by to say there
                        was a truce agreement between them and IS,” he says. “They
                        wanted us to clear the area.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He is no fan of IS, but he couldn’t miss a business
                        opportunity - even if some of the 4,000 surprise customers
                        driving through his village were armed to the teeth.

                        A small bridge in the village created a bottleneck so the
                        IS fighters got out and went shopping. After months of
                        fighting and taking cover in bunkers, they were pale and
                        hungry. They filed into his shop and, he says, they
                        cleared his shelves.

                      <p>
                        “A one-eyed Tunisian fighter told me to fear God,” he
                        says. “In a very calm voice, he asked why I had shaved. He
                        said they would come back and enforce Sharia once again. I
                        told him we have no problem with Sharia laws. We're all
                        Muslims.”

                        Instant noodles, biscuits and snacks - they bought
                        everything they could get their hands on.

                      <p>
                        They left their weapons outside the shop. The only trouble
                        he had was when three of the fighters spied some
                        cigarettes – contraband in their eyes – and tore up the
                        boxes.

                        “They hoovered up the shop. I got overwhelmed by their
                        numbers. Many asked me for prices, but I couldn't answer
                        them because I was busy serving other people. So they left
                        money for me on my desk without me asking.”

                        - when it came to money, IS settled its bills.

                        North of the village, it’s a different landscape. A lonely
                        tractor ploughs a field, sending a plume of dust and sand
                        into the air that can be seen for miles. There are fewer
                        villages, and it’s here that the convoy sought to
                        disappear.

                          In Muhanad’s tiny village, people fled as the convoy
                          approached, fearing for their homes - and their lives.

                        <p>
                          But suddenly, the vehicles turned right, leaving the
                          main road for a desert track.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          “Two Humvees were leading the convoy ahead,” says
                          Muhanad. “They were organising it and wouldn't let
                          anyone pass them.”

                          As the convoy disappeared into the haze of the desert,
                          Muhanad felt no immediate relief. Almost everyone we
                          spoke to says IS threatened to return, its fighters
                          running a finger across their throats as they passed by.

                          The coalition now confirms that while it did not have
                          its personnel on the ground, it monitored the convoy

                          Past the last SDF checkpoint, inside IS territory - a
                          village between Markada and Al-Souwar - Abu Fawzi
                          reached his destination. His lorry was full of
                          ammunition and IS fighters wanted it hidden.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          When he finally made it back to safety, he was asked by
                          the SDF where he’d dumped the goods.

                          Raqqa’s freedom was bought with blood, sacrifice and
                          compromise. The deal freed its trapped civilians and
                          ended the fight for the city. No SDF forces would have
                          to die storming the last IS hideout.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But IS didn’t stay put for long. Freed from Raqqa, where
                          they were surrounded, some of the group's most-wanted
                          members have now spread far and wide across Syria and

                          The men who cut fences, climb walls and run through the
                          tunnels out of Syria are reporting a big increase in
                          people fleeing. The collapse of the caliphate is good
                          for business.

                          “In the past couple of weeks, we’ve had lots of families
                          leaving Raqqa and wanting to leave for Turkey. This week
                          alone, I personally oversaw the smuggling of 20
                          families,” says Imad, a smuggler on the Turkish-Syrian
                          border.
                        </p>
                        <p>“Most were foreign but there were Syrians as well.”</p>
                        <p>
                          He now charges $600 (£460) per person and a minimum of
                          $1,500 for a family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In this business, clients don’t take kindly to
                          inquiries. But Imad says he’s had “French, Europeans,
                          Chechens, Uzbek”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          “Some were talking in French, others in English, others
                          in some foreign language,” he says.

                          Walid, another smuggler on a different stretch of the
                          Turkish border, tells the same story.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          “We had an influx of families over the past few weeks,”
                          he says. “There were some large families crossing. Our
                          job is to smuggle them through. We've had a lot of
                          foreign families using our services.”

                        <p>
                          As Turkey has increased border security, the work has
                          become more difficult.

                          Smuggling didn’t work out for everyone. Abu Musab
                          Huthaifa was one of Raqqa’s most notorious figures. The
                          IS intelligence chief was on the convoy out of the city
                          on 12 October.

                          But in Raqqa, it behaved no differently from any other
                          losing side. Cornered, exhausted and fearful for their
                          families, IS fighters were bombed to the negotiating
                          table on 10 October.

                          They killed about 500 or 600 people, fighters and
                          families,” says Abu Musab Huthaifa.

                          neighbourhood of Raqqa on 11 October shows a human
                          catastrophe behind enemy lines. Amid the screams of the
                          women and children, there is chaos among the IS
                          fighters. The bombs appear especially powerful,
                          especially effective. Activists claim that a building
                          housing 35 women and children was destroyed. It was
                          enough to break their resistance.

                          who initially rejected the truce changed their minds.
                          And thus we left Raqqa,” says Abu Musab.

                          There had been three previous attempts to negotiate a
                          peace deal. A team of four, including local Raqqa
                          officials, now led the talks. One brave soul would cross

                          revealed details of what happened to the convoy when it
                          made it safely to IS territory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          He says the convoy went to the countryside of eastern
                          Syria, not far from the border with Iraq.
                        </p>
                        <p>Thousands escaped, he says.</p>
                        <p>
                          Abu Musab’s own attempted escape serves as a warning to
                          the West of the threat from those freed from Raqqa.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          How could one of the most notorious of IS chiefs escape
                          through enemy territory and almost evade capture?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          “I remained with a group which had set its mind on
                          making its way to Turkey,” Abu Musab says.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Islamic State members were wanted by everyone else
                          outside the group’s shrinking area of control; that
                          meant this small gathering had to pass through swathes
                          of hostile territory.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          “We hired a smuggler to navigate us out of
                          SDF-controlled areas,” Abu Musab says.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          At first it went well. But smugglers are an unreliable
                          lot. “He abandoned us midway. We were left to fend for
                          ourselves in the midst of SDF areas. From then on, we
                          disbanded and it was every man for himself,” says Abu
                          Musab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          He might have made it to safety if only he’d paid the
                          right person or maybe taken a different route.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          The other path is to Idlib, to the west of Raqqa.
                          Countless IS fighters and their families have found a
                          haven there. Foreigners, too, also make it out -
                          including Britons, other Europeans and Central Asians.
                          The costs range from $4,000 (£3,000) per fighter to
                          $20,000 for a large family.

                        Abu Basir al-Faransy, a young Frenchman, left before the
                        going got really tough in Raqqa. He’s now in Idlib, where
                        he says he wants to stay.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The fighting in Raqqa was intense, even back then, he
                        says.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “We were front-line fighters, waging war almost constantly
                        [against the Kurds], living a hard life. We didn't know
                        Raqqa was about to be besieged.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Disillusioned, weary of the constant fighting and fearing
                        for his life, Abu Basir decided to leave for the safety of
                        Idlib. He now lives in the city.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He was part of an almost exclusively French group within
                        IS, and before he left some of his fellow fighters were
                        given a new mission.

                          There are some French brothers from our group who left
                          for France to carry out attacks in what would be called
                          a ‘day of reckoning.’”

                        Much is hidden beneath the rubble of Raqqa and the lies
                        around this deal might easily have stayed buried there
                        too.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The numbers leaving were much higher than local tribal
                        elders admitted. At first the coalition refused to admit
                        the extent of the deal.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, somewhat
                        improbably, continue to maintain that no deal was done.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And this may not even have been about freeing civilian
                        hostages. As far as the coalition is concerned, there was
                        no transfer of hostages from IS to coalition or SDF hands.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        And despite coalition denials, dozens of foreign fighters,
                        according to eyewitnesses, joined the exodus.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The deal to free IS was about maintaining good relations
                        between the Kurds leading the fight and the Arab
                        communities who surround them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It was also about minimising casualties. IS was well dug
                        in at the city’s hospital and stadium. Any effort to
                        dislodge it head-on would have been bloody and prolonged.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The war against IS has a twin purpose: first to destroy
                        the so-called caliphate by retaking territory and second,
                        to prevent terror attacks in the world beyond Syria and
                        Iraq.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Raqqa was effectively IS’s capital but it was also a cage
                        - fighters were trapped there.
                      </p>
                      <p>The deal to save Raqqa may have been worth it.</p>
                      <p>
                        But it has also meant battle-hardened militants have
                        spread across Syria and further afield – and many of them
                        aren’t done fighting yet.
